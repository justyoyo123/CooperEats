# CooperEats
This branch contains all the frontend work as well as backend edits off of springboot_user_auth branch.

## How to Run Test Coverage
The tests were written for the original version of the backend which is on springboot_user_auth. To reproduce the coverage 
results, you will need to checkout to springboot_user_auth branch, then to the for_test_coverage branch. Then, the Inteillij profiling tool can be used.
